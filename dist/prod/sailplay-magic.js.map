The touchend also calls preventGhostClick().\n  // - preventGhostClick() removes the allowable region the global touchstart created.\n  // - The browser generates a click event.\n  // - The global click handler catches the click, and checks whether it was in an allowable region.\n  //     - If preventGhostClick was called, the region will have been removed, the click is busted.\n  //     - If the region is still there, the click proceeds normally.
