This means that no unsafe input can make\n *   it into the returned string.\n *\n *   The whitelist for URL sanitization of attribute values is configured using the functions\n *   `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider\n *   `$compileProvider`}.\n *\n *   The input may also contain SVG markup if this is enabled via {@link
