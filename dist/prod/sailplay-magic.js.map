Most mobile browsers wait about 300ms after a tap-and-release before sending\n\t * the click event. This version handles them immediately, and then prevents the\n\t * following click event from propagating.\n\t *\n\t * Requires the {@link ngTouch `ngTouch`} module to be installed.\n\t *\n\t * This directive can fall back to using an ordinary click event, and so works on desktop\n\t * browsers as well as mobile.\n\t *\n\t * This directive also sets the CSS class `ng-click-active` while the element is being held\n\t * down (by a mouse click or touch) so you can restyle the depressed element if you wish.\n\t *\n\t * @element ANY\n\t * @param {expression} ngClick {@link guide/expression Expression} to evaluate\n\t * upon tap.

This results in\n\t  // tapping/clicking twice. We do \"clickbusting\" to prevent it.\n\t  //\n\t  // How does it work?\n\t  // We attach global touchstart and click handlers, that run during the capture (early) phase.\n\t  // So the sequence for a tap is:\n\t  // - global touchstart: Sets an \"allowable region\" at the point touched.\n\t  // - element's touchstart: Starts a touch\n\t  // (- touchcancel ends the touch, no click follows)\n\t  // - element's touchend: Determines if the tap is valid (didn't move too far away, didn't hold\n\t  //   too long) and fires the user's tap handler. The touchend also calls preventGhostClick().\n\t  // - preventGhostClick() removes the allowable region the global touchstart created.\n\t  // - The browser generates a click event.\n\t  // - The global click handler catches the click, and checks whether it was in an allowable region.\n\t  //     - If preventGhostClick was called, the region will have been removed, the click is busted.\n\t  //     - If the region is still there, the click proceeds normally. Therefore clicks on links and\n\t  //       other elements without ngTap on them work normally.\n\t  //\n\t  // This is an ugly, terrible hack!\n\t  // Yeah, tell me about it. The alternatives are using the slow click events, or making our users\n\t  // deal with the ghost clicks, so I consider this the least of evils. Fortunately Angular\n\t  // encapsulates this ugly logic away from the user.\n\t  //\n\t  // Why not just put click handlers on the element?\n\t  // We do that too, just to be sure.

The touchend also calls preventGhostClick().\n  // - preventGhostClick() removes the allowable region the global touchstart created.\n  // - The browser generates a click event.\n  // - The global click handler catches the click, and checks whether it was in an allowable region.\n  //     - If preventGhostClick was called, the region will have been removed, the click is busted.\n  //     - If the region is still there, the click proceeds normally.
